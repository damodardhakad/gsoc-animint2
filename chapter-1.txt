Question 1 - What is the difference between small and medium data?
Answer - Small data is simple to understand with no analysis needed. While medium data set have a fair amount of data such that if
we want to comfortably analyze data, visualization will be helpful to reduce the complexity.


Question 2 - What is the difference between medium and large data?
Answer - Large data have more number of observations(rows) compare to medium data. Large data usually have thousand of 
observations and analyzing them may require 2D or 3D visualization. The traditional approach to work on large data is summarizing
them to the size of medium data and then make a visual chart or graph.
